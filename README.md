# Advancing Virtual Try-On: A Multi-Step Evaluation Pipeline for Image Generation, Garment Testing, and Resolution Enhancement
The rapid advancements in virtual try-on technology have opened new frontiers in digital fashion and e-commerce, yet challenges in garment fidelity and visual realism persist. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation pipeline to assess the capabilities and limitations of state-of-the-art try-on models like IDM-VTON. The process begins with generating high-quality, digitally created models in diverse outfits and environments using the black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev model, enhanced with the Flux-uncensored-v2 weights. Garments sourced from the internet are seamlessly applied to these models using IDM-VTON, leveraging its advanced diffusion-based approach to ensure authenticity and detail preservation. To further refine the visuals, image resolution is enhanced through the jasperai/Flux.1-dev-ControlNet-Upscaler, creating outputs that meet real-world expectations. This article delves into the strengths and gaps identified in try-on performance, offering insights into the future potential of virtual try-on systems.
